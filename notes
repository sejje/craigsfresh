have a Fetcher class as part of a Section?


have a list of Watch objects

loop over list
  if it's not time yet:
	  pass
  else:
	  send request with callback

Watch.callback:
	save html as soup
	test for differences



what if two Watches are watching the same URL?
	1) watch could request from a cache
	2) Watch could request from Sub, sub does the watching
	  2a) Maybe Sub can push event to relevant Watches, so maybe

ALTERNATE:
	have a list of Sub objects (and a list of Watch objects)
	loop over Subs:
		if it's not time yet: pass
		if it's time: request with callback

	Subs.callback:
		for elem in Watch:
			if Watch.url = self.url:
				Watch.do_shit
